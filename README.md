## Our Motivation

The proposed system aims to help the Bilkent Information Office in its digital transformation. We focus on eliminating the extensive use of spreadsheets which is prone to errors. The process of
transferring information between spreadsheets can be frustrating if done manually. Thus, we target on reducing the time spent for daily tasks and make everything run smoother for our 
voluntary friends from Bilkent!

## Our Goals

The project's main goals include scheduling tours for high schools, assigning guides to these tours, tracking the performance of these guides, and tracking statistics for high schools. We also want to collect feedback from visitor high schools at the end of each tour to record the performance of the guides. These records will prove useful for filtering purposes. Additionally, we aim to contribute to the process of accepting schools for tours via ordering schools by ranking them based on their statistics and therefore making it easier to move data between spreadsheets, reducing manual work.

## Solving Problems

Our app will make it easy to assign guides to tours and remind them of their tasks. Secondly, it will track how well guides perform by collecting feedback from the schools. Finally, it will eliminate getting lost in spreadsheets, like duplicates being created because of the spreadsheets being maintained manually by different employees or double entries by schools, improving the overall efficiency of the information office.
 
## Features

The web app will have several important features. It will allow high schools to submit applications online. It will schedule tours for them and assign guides to each tour. Our app will send email reminders to the guides before their assigned tours. After the tours, feedback will be collected from the high school counselors or teachers, which includes their thoughts and points for the guide. This feedback will be used to see the guide's performance.
 
## Selling Points / What makes it cool?

We aim for simplicity and intuitiveness so that every user feels comfortable using this app. Apart from that, one of the cool aspects of our app is a feedback system. It will allow our customers to track how well guides perform and create a competition between them. The better they do, the more motivated they will be to continue improving. Another cool feature is the data visualization dashboard for high school statistics for only admins to see, which will allow the information office to better understand which schools are better to host in Bilkent.
 
## Extra Work

Our extra work involves a couple of extra features that we aim to implement: 
1. A data analysis dashboard that allows admins to see which high schools are better compared to others. 
2. A competition system among the guides based on feedback from the schools; high school counselors will give points out of ten to the guide in different metrics. 
3. We will focus on deploying the project, making sure it runs in a real-world environment.
